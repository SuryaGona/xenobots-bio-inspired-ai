## 🧬 What are Xenobots?

Xenobots are tiny living robots created from frog stem cells (Xenopus laevis) and shaped by AI evolutionary algorithms. First introduced by Kriegman et al. in 2020, they represent a revolutionary approach to programmable biology.

## 🛠️ How We Designed Them

- Used evolutionary simulations to test thousands of body plans
- Selected optimal designs for behaviors like movement and particle collection
- Cells self-assembled into functional bots matching simulation predictions
- Explored unexpected phenomena like self-healing and collective swarm behavior

## 💡 Key Features

- Fully biodegradable
- Capable of self-repair
- Can move, push particles, and act collectively
- Potential in medicine (e.g., targeted drug delivery) and environment (e.g., microplastic removal)

## ❓ Ethical Questions Explored

- Should AI-designed lifeforms be given legal protection?
- Could these organisms evolve in the wild?
- What frameworks are needed for responsible development?
